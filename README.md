## Contributing

### Branching

For every task a developer creates a branch with a dash-delimited name. Once the task is finished the branch is merged into master and deleted.

### Code style

* Class member variables begin with `m`. Example: `mNodes`
* Android Studio default settings are the standard we use.
* All gradle lint warnings have to be resolved before a pull request
